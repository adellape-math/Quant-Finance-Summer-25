# Quant-Finance-Summer-25

## Final Project Submission for Quant Finance Summer 2025

* Mini Project 1 employs Python and optimization techniques to build two distinct investment portfolios – one designed for higher risk tolerance and another prioritizing lower risk, both based on historical stock data.

* Mini Project 2 tests the common assumption in mathematical finance that stock and index log returns follow a normal distribution. Our analysis uses historical data from YFinance, and the investigation explores several methods including identifying periods of normal behavior, evaluating the impact of removing extreme values, constructing portfolios with more normally distributed returns than individual stocks, and finally analyzing the normality assumptions of risk-optimized portfolios.

* Mini Project 3 focuses on analyzing the behavior of Black-Scholes call and put option prices both over time and in relation to the underlying asset's spot price. It involves creating visualizations to understand how the rate of change of both call and put options evolves as time passes and as the spot price fluctuates. The goal is to gain insights into the dynamics of these options and record observations and reflections based on the resulting plots.

* Mini Project 4 delves into a more realistic scenario of delta hedging sold call options by considering the crucial factor of non-constant volatility (sigma).  The core concept of delta hedging – creating a portfolio insensitive to small movements in the underlying stock price – is typically predicated on the assumption of stable volatility. This project challenges that assumption. The goal is to investigate how fluctuations in volatility impact the profit distribution of a delta-hedging strategy, and specifically, it involves exploring how changes in Sigma affect the potential gains and losses of the hedge.
